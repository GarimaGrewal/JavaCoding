// Alice and Bob always loved to play with arrays. Alice took a sorted array and rotated it clockwise for a certain number of times. For example, Alice took a sorted array = [4,6,8,10,11] and if she rotates it by 3, then the array becomes: [8, 10, 11, 4, 6].
// After rotating a sorted array, Alice gave a number â€˜Kâ€™ to Bob and asked him to search for a pair in an array whose sum is equal to K. Since Bob was busy preparing for his semester exams, he asked you to help him.
// You are given an array of integers ARR and a number K. Your task is to find out whether there exists a pair in the array ARR with sum K or not. If there exists a pair then you can return TRUE else return FALSE;
